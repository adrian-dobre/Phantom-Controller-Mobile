This is the flutter-based mobile application used to control
the [Phantom Controller device](https://github.com/adrian-dobre/Phantom-Controller)
It can perform all the functions that the standard remote, shipped with NovingAir Phantom (Wireless
or Active), can perform plus monitoring temperature, relative humidity, ambient light, pressure and
CO2 levels.
